# DataframeGUIKivy

Port of Dataframe GUI module to a Kivy widget. Original module can be found at this repository: https://github.com/bluenote10/PandasDataFrameGUI

# Updates
This fork has been updated to use the current version of all required libraries.

* matplotlib _png is no longer needed to be imported and was removed
*  pandas.DataFrame.from_items was [deprecated since version 0.23.0](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.23.4/pandas/core/frame.py#L1422-L1507) 
and has been replaced with pandas.DataFrame.from_dict
* kivy.garden.matplotlib was giving me trouble so I just included the source in garden.matplotlib
* added in requirements.txt so all requirements can be installed through pip.
